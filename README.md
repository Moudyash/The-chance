### 🧩 Task 1: Sudoku Checker ✅
- **Description**: A function that validates a Sudoku puzzle according to the rules—no duplicate numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.
- **Requirements**:
  - Use Test-Driven Development (TDD): write all test cases first.
  - Start with a dummy function that always returns false.
  - Implement the logic step by step until all tests pass.
  - Design a complete flowchart using [draw.io](https://draw.io).
  - (Extra) Make the function dynamic to support 4x4 or 16x16 puzzles.
- **Status**: ✔️ Completed

### 🌐 Task 2: IPv4 Address Checker ✅
- **Description**: A function that checks if a string is a valid IPv4 address based on:
  - Four numeric segments between 0 and 255
  - No leading zeros except for "0"
  - Exactly three dots, no extra characters
- **Requirements**:
  - Follow TDD structure
  - Write tests before implementation
  - Build the function incrementally until all tests pass
  - Design a flowchart with [draw.io](https://draw.io)
- **Status**: ✔️ Completed
